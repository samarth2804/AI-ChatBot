# AI ChatBot
Developed an AI chatbot using the MERN stack and OpenAI API, similar to ChatGPT.
▪ Implemented user authentication and authorization mechanisms, utilizing JWT tokens and HTTP Only Cookies for
security.
▪ Utilized MongoDB for efficient storage of user conversations and Material UI for a visually appealing chat interface.

# features:
- Users can Login/Signup using local method(username password) and after successful authentication the user is provided with a jwt token which is saved as browser's http only cookies.
- Users can chat and ask for their queries to the ai-bot. This conversation gets stored in the database and the user can access it anytime. Users also have the ability to clear their conversation.
- I am working on integrating Google OAuth Authentication.
